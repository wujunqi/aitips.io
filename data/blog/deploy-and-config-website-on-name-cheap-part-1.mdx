I've always wanted to have my own personal site, but due to ~~laziness~~ lack of time, I only got to work on it recently while staying at home during the quarantine.

In this post, I'll guide you on how to set up and configure a **domain** and **web hosting** that you purchased on Namecheap (assuming you already have your own source code <Twemoji emoji="smiling-face-with-sunglasses" />)

## Why this tutorial?

Even though Namecheap has a [detailed tutorial](https://www.namecheap.com/resource-center/tutorials/building-your-first-website/) on building a website from scratch, swimming <Twemoji emoji="man-swimming" /> through a sea of documentation isn't that easy.

So, I wrote this tutorial to share what I learned and did in **2 days** to ~~remind myself if I forget in the future~~ help you set up your site faster <Twemoji emoji="beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes" />.

## What do you need for a complete site?

At first, I thought I only needed to buy a **domain** and push my code there. But that's not enough; the 3 basics to run a website are: **domain name**, **hosting**, and **platform**

- **Domain name** <Twemoji emoji="magnifying-glass-tilted-right" />: This is your website address, e.g., _[pondhub.com](http://www.thepondhub.com/)_, _[leohuynh.dev](https://leohuynh.dev)_ ... Think of it like your home address, making it easier to find than using an IP address.
- **Hosting** <Twemoji emoji="house" />: This is where all your website's data and information are stored.
  > -- Web hosting, in simple terms, is a remote hard drive connected to your computer via (you guessed it) the Internet.

If the domain is your home address, then hosting is your actual house.

- **Platform** <Twemoji emoji="laptop" />: These are the tools to build your website, with the source code being the main product.

=> You need to buy both **domain** and **hosting** for a complete site.

I decided to buy both on Namecheap ~~due to lack of experience~~ for easy configuration and support from their team <Twemoji emoji="beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes" />

Go to [https://www.namecheap.com/domains/](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/) (make sure to create an account first), search for a domain, click **Add To Cart**. Namecheap will suggest buying **Web Hosting** and **PositiveSSL** (which is for securing your site—more on that [below](#activate-ssl-certificate)).

Buying on Namecheap is pretty straightforward. Just provide the required information, pay up <Twemoji emoji="money-with-wings" /><Twemoji emoji="money-with-wings" /><Twemoji emoji="money-with-wings" /> and you're done.

## How to connect domain and hosting?

Your house and address are obviously in one place, so why connect them <Twemoji emoji="eyes" />?

The simple reason is that a house address (**Web hosting**) is actually a sequence of numbers (**IP Address**, e.g., **127.0.0.1**). You need to go to that address to access the website.

=> You need to connect the **domain name** to **hosting** so people can get to the right place using an easy-to-remember address.

If you buy both **domain** and **hosting** on **Namecheap**, the configuration is quite easy:

- Go to **Account / Dashboard / Domain List**, click **Manage** on the domain you just bought.
- Select **Namecheap Web Hosting DNS** in the **Nameservers** section.
- Click save (the <Twemoji emoji="check-mark-button" /> icon at the end of the line).
- Done.

Why can we access the website using ~~**domain name**~~ a simpler address <Twemoji emoji="eyes" />?

It's all thanks to DNS (I won't dive into this concept).

> DNS (domain name system) is simply **_The Phone Book of the Internet_**. You can dial the number (IP Address) directly to call your crush (hosting), or look them up by name (domain) in your contact list.

## Activate SSL Certificate

If you didn't buy **PositiveSSL**, you can skip this section.

**SSL** (Secure Sockets Layer) is a security layer for your website, protecting it with **HTTPS** with two main purposes:

- Ensuring that the data going to and from your site is always encrypted.
- Verifying that the incoming and outgoing data is accurate.

![SSL certificate](/static/images/https.png)

Websites with **SSL Certificate** are marked as **Secured** on browsers, ensuring user trust.

The simplest way to activate this is through **cPanel** on **Namecheap**:

![Go to cPanel](/static/images/cpanel.png)

- Go to **Account / Dashboard / Domain List**, select the **Products** tab.
- Click **Go to cPanel**, log in with your **Namecheap** account.
- In **cPanel**, open **Namecheap SSL**.
- Click **Activate** PositiveSSL.

Wait for about 5-10 minutes, then click **sync** to see if it's been successfully activated (if not, wait a bit more and **sync** again until the status changes to **active**).

## Wrap Up

By now, you've completed 90% of your website setup <Twemoji emoji="astonished-face" />, in the [next part](/blog/deploy-and-config-website-on-namecheap-part-2), I'll guide you through the remaining ~~90%~~ 10% <Twemoji emoji="smiling-face-with-tear" />, including:

- Understanding the folder structure on the server (**web hosting**).
- Using [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to push code to the server.
- Setting up 2FA (**Two-Factor Authentication**) to enhance security.
