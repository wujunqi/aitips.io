In the [previous part](/blog/deploy-and-config-website-on-name-cheap-part-1), I guided you through buying and connecting your **domain** to **hosting**, and activating the **SSL Certificate**.

In this part, I'll show you how to push your code to the **server** and get your website live <Twemoji emoji="rocket" />

## What's on the server <Twemoji emoji="eyes" size="base" />?

To understand the folder structure on the server, go to **cPanel** (I showed you how to access it in the previous post). Open **File Manager** in the **Files** section.

![cpanel file manager](/static/images/file-manager.png)

This is the folder structure on the server! By default, we'll be in the **root directory**: `/home/<cpanel-username>`.

The folder we need to focus on is `./public_html`, which contains all the source code (_html_, _css_, _js_) of the website. Our main goal is to put all the code files here.

**File Manager** allows direct upload of files but not **folders** <Twemoji emoji="man-getting-massage" />. That's why I use a tool **Namecheap** [recommends](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/1279/205/how-to-set-up-filezilla/), which is [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).

## Authorize FileZilla

**FileZilla** will connect and <Twemoji emoji="delivery-truck" /> push the code to the **server** by accessing the server using FTP (**File Transfer Protocol**).

For a **middle-man** <Twemoji emoji="man-construction-worker-medium-light-skin-tone" /> to help us upload files to the **server**, we need to grant access to that tool => Create an [**FTP Account**](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9523/205/how-to-create-an-ftp-account), and **FileZilla** will use this account to upload code for us.

Creating an **FTP Account** is very simple:

- Go to **cPanel**, click **FTP Accounts** in the **Files** section.
- Enter the **username** and **password** (don't forget it <Twemoji emoji="grinning-face-with-sweat" />).

![FTP Account](/static/images/ftp.png)

**Note <Twemoji emoji="warning" />:** When creating an **FTP Account**, make sure to set the `access-directory` of this account to the `root-directory`. Otherwise, this account won't have access to the `./public_html` folder <Twemoji emoji="grinning-face-with-sweat" />

## Setup FileZilla

After [downloading](https://filezilla-project.org/) and installing **FileZilla**, we will connect to the server using the **FTP Account** we just created.

[Quick connect](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/1279/205/how-to-set-up-filezilla/#quickconnect) is the simplest way to connect to the server. You'll need 4 pieces of information:

- **Host name**: `ftpes://<host-name>` (don't forget the `ftpes://` prefix!)

![Host name](/static/images/hostname.png)

_(The host name is right at the **URL** in **cPanel**)_.

- **Username**: The **FTP Account** username you just created, in this format: `<ftp-account-name>@<your-domain>`
- **Password**
- **Port**: default is `21`.

Enter all the information and click **Quickconnect**.
You should see a **successful** signal to proceed.

![Connect to server via FileZilla](/static/images/filezilla.png)

_(Don't worry if you see the **port** disappear, **FileZilla** does that automatically <Twemoji emoji="face-with-steam-from-nose" />)_

## Push code to the server

The complicated part is done <Twemoji emoji="see-no-evil-monkey" /> <Twemoji emoji="hear-no-evil-monkey" />, now it's time to push your code to the **server**!

<div>
  <img src="/static/images/close.gif" alt="close" style={{ margin: '0 auto' }} />
</div>

In **FileZilla**, there are 2 sections:

- **Local site**: This contains all the folders on your machine. Navigate to the folder containing your code (make sure it's the built code). In my case, it's the `./public` folder (it could be `./build`, `./dist`, `./public` ... depending on your app configuration).

- **Remote site**: This shows all the folders on the **server**. Navigate to `./public_html`.

![Close](/static/images/filezilla2.png)

Select all files in **Local** and drag them over to **Remote** ... and it's done <Twemoji emoji="party-popper" />

Now just open your site, check the results, and fix typos if any <Twemoji emoji="grinning-squinting-face" /><Twemoji emoji="grinning-squinting-face" /><Twemoji emoji="grinning-squinting-face" />

/>

## Two-Factor Authentication (Optional)

Two-Factor Authentication (**2FA**) is an additional security layer for your **Namecheap** account (you need to pass both layers to access your resources, so you won't have to worry if your account gets compromised, since the second layer is on a separate device).

The first layer is your **username/password**, and the second layer can be one of the following:

- **U2F (Universal 2nd Factor)**: Using a [physical device](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/10102/45/how-can-i-use-the-u2f-method-for-twofactor-authentication) like a key to unlock the account.
- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Using a short-term password on another device via an **Authentication app** like: [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en), [Authy](https://authy.com/) ...
- **Text Message Authentication**: Using SMS on your phone.

I chose **TOTP** via the [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en) app.

Download the app on your phone, then go to **cPanel** and open **Two-Factor Authentication** in the **Security** section, scan the **QR Code**, and you're done!

From now on, Namecheap will ask for the **TOTP** code from the app whenever you log in to ensure security.

## Wrap Up

I hope this tutorial helps you understand more about the server and how to host your own website.

If you don't want to buy hosting, you can use other **Free Hosting Services** like: **Github Page**, **Heroku**, **Netlify**, **Vercel** ... (all of them support **build tools** and **configuration**, so you just need to **connect** your source code and you're good to go).

Happy deploying!
