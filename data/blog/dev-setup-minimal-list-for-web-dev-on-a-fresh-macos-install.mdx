Setting up a new dev environment on a new device can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to choosing the right tools and configurations.
This blog post recommend you a list of the minimal setup needed to get started with web development on a fresh macOS install.

I could guarantee that this list should only take you around 30" to get your hands dirty with coding <Twemoji emoji="love-you-gesture" />.

> This list is based on my personal Mac setup. It may not be the best for everyone,
> but I believe it's the most minimal and most simple setup you can choose
> to start working as fast as possible.

## System preferences

I recommend turning on the following settings:

#### Mouse

- Increase mouse tracking speed.
- Enable **"Natural scrolling"**.
- Click on the right side for **right-click**.
- Enable **Smart zoom**.

#### Keyboard

- Set the key repeat rate to **fast** (max to the right side).
- Set the delay until key repeat to **short** (max to the right side).

#### Appearance (Optional)

- Use **Light** mode for the whole system.
- Turn on **Night Shift** in the **Displays** settings (Scheduling from **Sunset to Sunrise**),
  this could protect your eyes from blue light in the night time.

<Twemoji emoji="thinking-face" /> Why `Light` mode?

**Dark** mode was my go-to mode since I started learning to code, but for the last few years, my eyes don't adjust to the dark mode very well.
Which makes me switch to the **Light** mode from time to time. I've been using all day and all things **Light** mode for like 2 years now, and I'm really happy with it.

## Web browser

Since we will need to open many links later, using a browser that fits our needs is the first step.
I've tried [Arc](https://arc.net/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) so far,
but at the end of the day, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is still the best fit for me.

You can download and install it from the [official website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## iTerm2

Download and install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), it's a better replacement for the default Mac Terminal app.
Remember to drag the downloaded app to the **Applications** folder so you can launch it from the Launchpad.

**iTerm2** comes with a bunch of [beautiful themes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/), you can choose the one you like.
For me, I'm using the `Solarized Light` theme since I prefer light mode.

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install and manage softwares.
First, you will need to install the **Command Line Developer Tools** for **Xcode** with:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then download and install Homebrew using the command from the [official website](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This could take a while, so be patient. Remember to keep track of the installation process. You might be asked to enter your password.

Once the installation is complete, you can check with:

```bash showLineNumbers
brew doctor
Your system is ready to brew. # If you see this, you're good to go
```

For more information on how to use Homebrew's commands, check out their [documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/).

## Git

Install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) with:

```bash showLineNumbers
brew install git

# When done, verify the installation with
which git
# /usr/local/bin/git
```

Next, you will need to configure your **Git** user name and email address.
I recommend setting up them globally with:

```bash showLineNumbers
git config --global user.name "your-github-username"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

## Visual Studio Code

If you prefer another IDE, you can bypass this step and install your favorite one.

For me, I've been using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) since 2018 and I love it.
It's super fast, lightweight, and has a lot of great features.

Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
(then drag and drop the downloaded app to the **Applications** folder).

I recommend install the following extensions for a better dev experience:

- [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) - unified editor config for all your projects.
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - every developers should have this extension.
- [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv) - syntax highlighting for **.env** files.
- [Git Blame](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waderyan.gitblame) - a better alternative to **GitLens**, since I found it to be slow and too much unnecessary features (for me, I only use it for **Git Blame**).
- [Supermaven](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=supermaven.supermaven) - The fastest copilot (as in their introduction, and I really feel it's faster than Github Copilot).
- [Turbo Console Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log) - quickly log any objects or functions (in your JS code base) with a keyboard shortcut.
- [TailwindCSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) - a must have extension for **Tailwind CSS** developers.

You can also refer to my keybindings and settings for VS Code [here](/snippets/vscode-settings).

## Python

I recommend using [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install Python (it allows us to manage multiple versions of Python, e.g., 2.x or 3.x).
Install `pyenv` with:

```bash
brew install pyenv
```

Please follow the instructions on the terminal since it will ask you to add something to your dotfiles.
After that, add this to your **.bash_profile** (you can open the file with `code ~/.bash_profile` or `vim ~/.bash_profile`):

```bash:.bash_profile
if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then eval "$(pyenv init -)"; fi
```

Save it and reload with:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now you can install the latest version of Python with:

```bash showLineNumbers
# First, list all the available versions
pyenv install --list

# Then install the latest version
pyenv install 3.x.x # Replace 3.x.x with the latest version you see in the list
```

## Node.js

The best way to install and manage Node.js is to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager).
`nvm` offers a simple way to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js in your system.

Install `nvm` with its [official script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script):

```bash showLineNumbers
# You should copy the script from Nvm's Github repo, since the version might change
# Up until this blog post, the latest version was 0.40.1
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

# When done, verify the installation with
command -v nvm
# nvm -> you should see this
```

Now install and manage Node.js versions should be as easy as:

```bash showLineNumbers
nvm install node # Install the latest version of Node.js
nvm use node # Use the latest version of Node.js
nvm use 22.x # Use Node.js 22.x
```

Node.js installation comes with `npm` as well, but you can also use other package managers.
I recommend trying `pnpm` since it's faster and is a great alternative to `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash showLineNumbers
npm install -g pnpm
```

You can check my [pnpm aliases](/snippets/pnpm-aliases) snippet to see how to use `pnpm` with aliases.

## Ruby

Like **Python**, **Ruby** is already installed on macOS, but you will need to use the latest version of Ruby.
The easiest way to install is to use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).
Install `rbenv` with:

```bash showLineNumbers
brew install rbenv
```

Then add this to your **.bash_profile**:

```bash:.bash_profile
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

Then reload your **.bash_profile** with:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You can now install the latest version of Ruby with:

```bash showLineNumbers
# List all the available versions
rbenv install --list

# Install the latest version
rbenv install 2.x.x # Replace 2.x.x with the latest version you see in the list
```

## Database

#### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open-source relational database management system.

Install it with `Homebrew`:

```bash showLineNumbers
brew install postgresql

# Then you can start the server with
brew services start postgresql
```

#### Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

Install it with `Homebrew`:

```bash showLineNumbers
brew install redis

# Then you can start the server with
brew services start redis
```

## Applications

As a developer, you will need to use a lot of applications and tools to work efficiently.
Here are some of the most common ones I use:

- [Cloudflare WARP](https://one.one.one.one/) - make your internet connection faster and more secure.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - API client for testing and prototyping.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) - messaging app for teams.
- [Monosnap](https://monosnap.com/) - simple screenshot tool which allows you to add annotations, crop, or resize your screenshots. (It can also be used as a screen recorder).
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) - music streaming service.
- [OpenKey](https://open-key.org/) - for Vietnamese developers, it's a great tool to type Vietnamese characters.

That's it! A dead simple list of the most required tools for a web developer to get started with coding as quickly as possible.

Am I missing something? Please let me know in the comment section.

Happy installing <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
